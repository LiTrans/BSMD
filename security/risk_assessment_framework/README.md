# Cyber-Security Risk Assessment Framework for Blockchains in Smart Mobility
Code of the paper Cyber-Security Risk Assessment Framework for Blockchains in Smart Mobility

## Abstract
In this paper, we carry out an analysis in terms of quantifying the risk associated
to a multi-layered Blockchain framework for Smart Mobility Data-markets (BSMD). We first construct an
actor-based analysis to determine the impact of the attacks. Then, a scenario-based analysis determines
the probability of occurrence of each threat. Finally, a combined analysis is developed to determine which
attack outcomes have the highest risk. In the case study of the public permissioned BSMD, the outcomes
of the risk analysis highlight the highest risk factors according to their impact on the victims in terms
of monetary, privacy, integrity and trust. The analysis uncovers specific blockchain technology security
vulnerabilities in the transportation ecosystem by exposing new attack vectors. The systematic risk analysis
here can be used to develop possible countermeasures against cybersecurity vulnerabilities in the smart
mobility implementations of the blockchain technology
